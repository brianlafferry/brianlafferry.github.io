For several years I’ve been studying programmatic investing.  I’ve tried pattern matching, a little genetic algorithms, and now looking at neural networks.  I’ve tried python, but do not see an interpreted language as a good choice for a program that needs to run 6 days a week, so I’m now looking at the old and rugid c language. 

In my research, I saw several persons asking for an “example with numbers”.  I would have liked to have found it, but rather than searching, I just jumped head long into it.  The HTML page was written for beginners, as I am a beginner.  

Net1.c calculates weight changes for one epoch.

When complete, net2.c will start with “random” weights, and be in a loop to do multiple epochs, testing that the algorithm is valid (if the error decreases with each epoch)
